    "We have RadioLand FM radio station data from 25 US cities. Each row represents a station that was receivable at a specific location. We want to **predict the field strength** (just how strong that signal will be) a station will have at a given location based on technical parameters like:\n",

    "- Transmitter power (ERP)\n",
    "- Frequency\n",

ML models can only learn from the data you give them. If your data has problems, your model will have problems too.\n\nThink of it like cooking: You can't make a great meal with spoiled ingredients, no matter how skilled the chef!\n\n### Common Data Quality Issues\n\nReal-world datasets often have:\n- **Missing values** (NaN, null, empty cells)\n- **Invalid values** (negative distances, impossible measurements)\n- **Outliers** (data entry errors, measurement glitches)\n- **Inconsistent formats** (different units, encoding issues)\n\n### What We're Cleaning in Our Dataset\n\nFor radio signal data, we need to remove:\n\n1. **Missing values**: Rows where key features (distance, power, etc.) are missing\n   - Why? Can't predict without complete information\n   \n2. **Physically impossible values**:\n   - Distance ≤ 0: You can't have negative or zero distance\n   - Power (ERP) ≤ 0: Transmitters must have positive power\n   - Field strength < -100 dBu: Signals this weak are essentially noise\n   \n3. **Why these specific thresholds?**\n   - Radio engineering has physical constraints\n   - Values outside these ranges indicate measurement errors or data issues\n\n### The Impact\n\nData cleaning typically removes 1-10% of rows, but dramatically improves model quality. Better to have 900 clean examples than 1000 messy ones!\n\nLet's clean our data:",

    "# Understanding the Machine Learning Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build our first model, let's understand the **5-step ML workflow** that we'll use throughout this lab. This is the standard process data scientists follow for most ML projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The 5 Steps Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Prepare Features (X) and Target (y)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is this?**  \n",
    "In ML, we need to separate our data into two parts:\n",
    "- **Features (X)**: The input variables we use to make predictions (also called \"independent variables\" or \"predictors\")\n",
    "- **Target (y)**: The output variable we want to predict (also called \"dependent variable\" or \"label\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Think of predicting exam scores:\n",
    "- Features (X) might be: hours studied, hours slept, attendance rate\n",
    "- Target (y) would be: exam score\n",
    "\n",
    "**In our radio problem:**\n",
    "- Features (X): distance, power (ERP), frequency, antenna height\n",
    "- Target (y): field strength (the signal power we want to predict)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** The model learns the relationship between X and y. Good features = better predictions!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Split into Training and Test Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is this?**  \n",
    "We divide our dataset into two parts:\n",
    "- **Training set** (typically 70-80% of data): Used to teach the model\n",
    "- **Test set** (typically 20-30% of data): Used to evaluate the model on unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** It's like studying for an exam:\n",
    "- Training set = practice problems you study from\n",
    "- Test set = the actual exam (different questions testing the same concepts)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**  \n",
    "- If we test on data the model has already seen (training data), we can't tell if it truly learned patterns or just memorized answers\n",
    "- Testing on unseen data tells us how well the model will perform in the real world\n",
    "- This helps detect **overfitting** (when a model memorizes training data but fails on new data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** We use `random_state=42` to ensure everyone gets the same random split (reproducibility).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Train the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is this?**  \n",
    "The model \"learns\" by finding mathematical patterns in the training data. For Linear Regression, it finds the best-fit line/plane/hyperplane through the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Like learning to throw a forward pass in football:\n",
    "- You practice many throws during practice (training data)\n",
    "- Your brain learns the relationship between arm angle, velocity, receiver distance, and completion\n",
    "- After many reps, you can predict how to adjust your throw for different routes and distances\n",
    "- On game day, you apply what you learned to new situations\n",

    "For Linear Regression, the model finds coefficients (weights) for each feature:\n",
    "```\n",
    "field_strength = (coef₁ × distance) + (coef₂ × power) + ... + intercept\n",

    "The training process adjusts these coefficients to minimize prediction errors on the training set.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Make Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is this?**  \n",
    "After training, we use the model to predict the target (y) for data it hasn't seen before (the test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** After studying practice problems, you now take the actual exam and answer new questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In code:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictions = model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the model does:**  \n",
    "It takes the test features and plugs them into the learned equation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "predicted_field_strength = (learned_coef₁ × test_distance) + (learned_coef₂ × test_power) + ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** Predictions are useless if we can't evaluate them—that's next!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Evaluate Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is this?**  \n",
    "We compare the model's predictions to the actual values and calculate metrics to quantify how well it performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common metrics for regression:**\n",
    "- **R² (R-squared)**: Ranges from 0 to 1 (sometimes negative if the model is terrible)\n",
    "  - 1.0 = perfect predictions\n",
    "  - 0.5 = explains 50% of variance\n",
    "  - 0.0 = model is no better than predicting the average\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Average prediction error in the same units as the target\n",
    "  - Lower is better\n",
    "  - If RMSE = 5 dBu, predictions are off by ~5 dBu on average\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute error\n",
    "  - Easier to interpret than RMSE\n",
    "  - Less sensitive to outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** After taking the exam:\n",
    "- You get your score (R²)\n",
    "- You see how many points you missed on average per question (MAE)\n",
    "- You analyze which topics you need to study more (feature importance)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**  \n",
    "- Tells us if the model is good enough for real-world use\n",
    "- Helps us compare different models\n",
    "- Guides improvements (e.g., \"we need better features!\")\n",

    "## What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The ML Workflow:**\n",
    "   - Load and clean data\n",
    "   - Prepare features (X) and target (y)\n",
    "   - Split into train/test sets\n",
    "   - Train model\n",
    "   - Evaluate and iterate\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regression Metrics:**\n",
    "   - **R²**: Proportion of variance explained (higher is better, max = 1.0)\n",
    "   - **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error (lower is better, same units as target)\n",
    "   - **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error (average prediction error)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering Matters:**\n",
    "   - Simple models (1 feature) can give baseline performance\n",
    "   - Adding relevant features improves predictions\n",
    "   - Creating new features from domain knowledge (physics, geography) can boost performance significantly\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **scikit-learn Basics:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "   from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error\n",
    "   \n",
    "   model = LinearRegression()\n",
    "   model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "   predictions = model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To continue learning:\n",
    "- Try other regression algorithms: Ridge, Lasso, RandomForest\n",
    "- Explore classification problems (predict station format from features)\n",
    "- Learn about cross-validation for more robust evaluation\n",
    "- Study regularization to prevent overfitting\n",
