# Week 12: Python Maps and Machine Learning
## CSC 2053 - Platform Based Computing - Lab 13

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will:
1. Creating interactive maps with Folium
2. Adding markers with custom popups and tooltips
3. rganizing data with layer controls
4. Advanced features: clustering, circles, heatmaps
5. Understand the basic ML workflow: data → features → model → evaluation
6. Build and evaluate regression models using scikit-learn
7. Compare model performance using metrics like R² and RMSE
8. Practice feature engineering to improve predictions
